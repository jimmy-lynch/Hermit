# Hermit

Hermit was created with Ian Washabaugh and Mahitha Reddy for or COMP 590 - Special Topics (User Interfaces) course in the fall of 2023. Hermit is a 'self-dating' app focused on supporting new grads, and people new to cities, on completing activities alone comfortably. This is a modernized take on social media, meant on uplifting the user and building positive interactions with the outside world. Challenges are split between 'Rejuvenate' (or at home) and 'Explore' (or out in the surrounding area). 

Our process can be outlined by:
- Initial user research (surveys and interviews)
- Defining key user groups and their goals
- Developing personas and Empathy Maps
- Sketches, mock-ups, and wireframes
- Hi-fidelity interactive prototype
- Initial user testing & notes for implementation
- Implementing with XCode, Swift, SwiftUI, Firebase, Cloud Firestore, and Apple MapKit
- Final presentation to stakeholders

The original source code is not on my personal computer, but I am working on accessing it to upload to this repository. We coded collaboratively, and while I do have portions of the screens I contributed too, I don't have the entire infastructure. However, I have linked our App Demo below that we used to present to stakeholders.
